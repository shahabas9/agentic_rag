WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY BORDERLANDS 4 GAME CODE?

Borderlands 4 keys will be sent out in line with the game’s official release schedule. Once your key is ready, you’ll receive it by email along with instructions on how to redeem it.

OFFICIAL RELEASE DATE

September 12, 2025

GLOBAL RELEASE TIMES FOR PC PLAYERS

Because Borderlands 4 is a global launch for PC only, release times vary depending on your time zone. Here are some examples:

September 11, 9 AM PT (San Francisco)

September 11, 12 PM ET (New York)

September 11, 4 PM UTC
September 11, 5 PM BST (London)

September 12, 12 AM SGT (Singapore)

September 12, 1 AM JST (Tokyo)

September 12, 2 AM AEST (Sydney)

Why this can feel confusing: Some players may see the game unlock “earlier” in their local time than others, but this is just how global time zones work. Everyone gets access at the same global moment, just adjusted to their region.

GLOBAL RELEASE TIMES FOR XBOX SERIES X|S PLAYERS
San Francisco, CA, USA - Sept 11 at 9:00 PM PT
New York, NY, USA - Sept 12 at 12:00 AM ET

Singapore - Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT

The only item that can’t be refunded at Loaded is a Loaded Gift Card. Everything else available on our website is covered by our Refund Policy, as explained in our Terms and Conditions.

So if you’ve purchased a game, subscription, or any other product, you may request a refund as long as it meets the policy requirements. To do that simply raise a support request and our team will take it from there.

CAN REFUNDS BE ISSUED IF THE KEY HAS BEEN REDEEMED OR ACTIVATED?
11 days ago Updated
Follow

We are unable to offer refunds for keys that have already been redeemed or activated on a gaming account. Once a key is used, it becomes permanently linked to that account and cannot be returned or resold.

Refunds are not available if the game does not run properly due to technical issues like crashes, poor performance, or compatibility problems. These issues are related to the game’s software and are best handled by the developer or publisher, as they can provide troubleshooting or release patches.

If your key is still unused and fits the conditions in our refund policy, you are welcome to submit a refund request. We will gladly help you through the process and make sure your concerns are handled promptly.

ARE THERE ANY FEES OR DEDUCTIONS FOR PROCESSING REFUNDS?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

At Loaded, we believe refunds should always be simple and fair. That’s why there are no fees or deductions when we process a refund for your order.

Once your request is reviewed and approved, you’ll always receive the full amount you originally paid—no hidden charges or penalties.

Refunds are processed in the same currency and payment method you used at checkout. The time it takes for the funds to show up depends on your bank, PayPal, or Apple Pay provider, but rest assured, the refunded amount will always match what you paid at purchase.

Whether you prefer store credit for your next game or funds returned directly to your account, we guarantee transparency and fairness every step of the way.

WHAT HAPPENS IF I USE A PROMO CODE AND REQUEST A REFUND?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

Just a heads-up about promo or voucher codes! These are for one-time use only, which means they can’t be reinstated if you request a refund on your order.

If you’ve used a discount code and later request a refund, we’ll refund the amount you actually paid after the discount was applied. That refund will go back to your original payment method.

When placing an order, you can only use one promotional or voucher code per order. This also applies to pre-orders. If you try to use more than one code, you’ll get an error at checkout. So, please make sure to enter only one promotional or voucher code to avoid any problems.

However, if you have a Loaded GiftCard, you can use multiple gift cards in the same order. This allows you to combine several gift cards to cover the full cost of your purchase, giving you more flexibility when paying.

Promo codes are usually intended for specific products or categories, but their use can vary depending on the code and the item you want to buy. Sometimes, promo codes can be used for pre-orders or already discounted items, but other times they might not be accepted for these purchases.

To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to check the terms and conditions of your promo code before you go to checkout. This way, you'll know exactly what the restrictions and eligibility rules are, helping you get the best out of your discount.

Promotional or voucher codes are intended for one-time use only and cannot be reactivated or used again once applied. If you receive a refund for an order where a promotional or voucher code was used, the code itself won’t be reinstated or available for reuse.

However, you don’t need to worry about the refund process. You will always get a full refund of the amount you paid after the discount was applied. This refund will be processed and returned directly to the original payment method used for the purchase, ensuring a straightforward and clear transaction.

If you need technical support for playing or using the content you’ve purchased, please note that Loaded isn’t able to provide direct assistance. This is because we act only as a third-party seller and don’t have the means to fix technical issues related to the content itself.

The best way to get help is to contact the game’s developer or the platform you’re using to access the content, such as Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, or similar services. These developers and platforms have the right expertise and resources to help you with any problems or technical difficulties you might face.

If you’d like additional support from our team, you’re welcome to send us a support request. We’ll do our best to assist where we can, though please understand our ability to resolve technical issues is limited since we’re a reseller.

Click the ‘Delete Account’ tab at the bottom of the page

If you’re having trouble accessing your account, don’t worry! Our support team can assist you with closing your account.

WHAT IS THE POLICY FOR REFUNDS ON CDKOINS?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

If you’d like a refund for an order paid with CDKoins, make sure to submit your request within 7 calendar days of your purchase and ensure the product key hasn’t been redeemed or activated on your gaming account. You can check our Terms and Conditions for more details.

Once we receive your request, our team will confirm the product hasn’t been used. If everything checks out, we’ll process your refund. Payments made using other methods can be refunded back to your original payment method.

Your CDKoins balance will be returned to your original Loaded account and should be available for use again within 10 working days after the refund is processed.

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MY ORDER CONFIRMATION EMAIL GOES TO MY SPAM OR JUNK FOLDER?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

If your order confirmation email from Loaded ends up in your spam or junk folder, there’s no need to worry. You can simply mark the email as “Not Spam”. This lets your email provider know that the message is safe and should be delivered to your inbox. Alternatively, you can add Loaded to your email contacts or address book, which also helps your email service recognise Loaded as a trusted sender.

By doing this, your email provider will be more likely to deliver future emails from Loaded, including order updates and important notifications, straight to your main inbox instead of your spam or junk folder. This way, you won’t miss any important information about your orders.

🚧 HEADS-UP: CRYPTO PAYMENTS ARE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE
10 days ago Updated
Follow

Just a quick update for you! Crypto payments are temporarily disabled on our site. This is due to some changes with our payment processor and internal policies. Nothing to worry about, it’s only temporary!

We’re already working on adding a new crypto payment processor, and if everything goes to plan, it should be available within the next few weeks.

🎉 In the meantime, you can still complete your purchase using any of our other available payment methods, including:

Credit or Debit Cards

PayPal

Apple Pay

Gift Cards

And more!

What if I paid with crypto and need a refund?
No worries, we’ve got that covered! While direct crypto refunds are temporarily unavailable, any eligible refunds for crypto orders will be issued as a Loaded gift card. This way, you’ll still be able to use the full value of your purchase on anything else from our store.

Thanks so much for your patience while we get this sorted out. If you have any questions, our support team is always here to help.

Uh oh! That’s not the experience we want you to have on Loaded.

As a first troubleshooting step, please check the following:

If you paid with ApplePay or PayPal, your key may have been sent to the email linked to that account.

If you’ve tried this and still can’t find your key, please submit a support request and include the following information:

Name of the product you ordered

Your first and last name

Your email address (or any other email you may have used for the order)

PayPal transaction ID or the first 6 and last 4 digits of your credit card

I RECEIVED AN 8-DIGIT PAYPAL VERIFICATION CODE, WHERE DO I USE IT?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

When you use PayPal at checkout for the first time, or if you enter an email address different from the one linked to your PayPal account, a pop-up will appear during the process. This pop-up will ask you to enter a unique one-time code.

Loaded will send this code directly to the email address registered with your PayPal account. By entering the code, you confirm your identity and verify that you are the authorised user of the PayPal account. This extra step helps to keep your order safe and secure, protecting both your personal details and your transaction.

Earning loyalty points is only possible when you purchase Games or DLC items. Unfortunately, purchases like Top-Ups or membership products do not qualify for the loyalty points.

Once you make an eligible purchase, your loyalty points will be credited to your account within 10 working days.

DOES MY PRE-ORDER INCLUDE ANY BONUS CONTENT?
12 days ago Updated
Follow

We’re thrilled to bring you pre-orders for some of the hottest upcoming games, so you can secure your copy early and jump straight in on release day!

Sometimes publishers add special extras to pre-orders, things like bonus content, early access, or exclusive in-game items. These bonuses come directly from the publisher, and they also decide which retailers or platforms will receive them.

That means not every pre-order at Loaded will include these extras, even if you’ve seen them advertised elsewhere. But don’t worry, if a bonus is included, we’ll make sure it’s clearly shown on the product page so you’ll always know exactly what’s part of your order.

Not sure if a game comes with a bonus? Just check the product details on our site, or reach out to our support team. We’re always happy to help confirm what’s included!

WE HAVE REBRANDED TO LOADED
10 days ago Updated
Follow

You may have already noticed, but we have changed our name from CDKeys (cdkeys.com) to Loaded (loaded.com). You can read our announcement post here!


✅ CHANGES AT A GLANCE

Here’s what you need to know, fast:

🔐 No new account needed → Log in with your same email & password.

🛒 Your purchase history is safe → All past orders are migrated.

🎮 Your unredeemed keys still work → Valid as always.

⏳ Pre-orders are unaffected → You’ll get your key on release day.

📧 Emails still from CDKeys (for now) → Will switch to Loaded soon.

🌐 Your App Experience Upgraded → Watch out for the new Loaded app and chrome app.

🛡️ Same team, same suppliers → Just a new name.

🙋 Support & refunds unchanged → Handled at support.cdkeys.com.

🔄 Some CDKeys branding remains → Will fade as we finish rebranding.

Your Questions Answered Here!

Do I need to create a new account for Loaded?
The great news is everything has been migrated for you. You can login with the same email and password as before.

What about my purchase history?
Yes. We migrated that too! Once you are logged into your Loaded account, you will see all your past purchases.

Is Loaded a safe and legitimate site?
Yes! It’s the same CDKeys team, with the same policies, and we’re working with the same suppliers to offer gamers the best discounts possible.

I still see some references to CDKeys on your website!
Yes. The rebrand will take some time to fully complete. You may still see some references to CDKeys for the next few weeks while we complete the rebrand process.

I have an unredeemed key from CDKeys.com - is it still valid?
Yes. It’s still valid. The switch from CDKeys to Loaded has no impact on key validity.

What happens to my active pre-orders?
The switch to Loaded has no impact on pre-orders. If you have a pre-order, you will receive your game key as expected.

Will my purchase confirmation emails now come from Loaded.com?
Eventually, yes. But for now they will come from CDKeys.

How do I contact customer support now?
You can contact customer support by going to support.loaded.com and completing a support ticket.

What happens if I need a refund for an order placed on CDKeys.com?
Refunds will be processed in the same way as before. Even if your order was placed on CDKeys.com, our support team will handle it through Loaded.

I have more questions!
Great. Please create a support ticket here and we will be happy to answer.

WHAT IS A CODE?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

A code, sometimes also called a product code, is a unique serial number made up of letters and numbers. You’ll use this code to register and activate the game, DLC, or content you’ve purchased.

Depending on the product and platform, your code will be provided either as a text code or as a scanned image of the code. Once entered on the correct platform, it unlocks your purchase so you can start playing the game or content.

WHAT IS THE VALIDITY OF THE CODES I PURCHASED?
12 days ago Updated
Follow

The validity of the codes you purchase from Loaded can vary depending on the type of product and the platform where you redeem them. Since the publisher or platform sets these rules, we are not able to provide an exact expiration date for every code.

To make sure you do not run into any problems, we recommend redeeming your code as soon as possible after purchase. This also fits with our policy, which does not allow the reselling of codes.

CAN I BE A RESELLER AND PURCHASE ON WHOLESALE FROM LOADED?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

The Loaded website is designed for personal use and small quantity purchases. We do not currently offer wholesale or bulk ordering.

Our focus is on delivering the best possible prices on games and digital products, which is why our deals are tailored for individual customers. You’ll always find great value on our site, but they are intended for personal use rather than large-scale orders.

DO THE GAMES WORK IN ALL COUNTRIES?
10 days ago Updated
Follow

Each product page on Loaded clearly shows the region or country where a game can be activated. It is important to check this information before you buy, so you can be sure the key will work with your account.

Here is a quick guide:

Worldwide (WW): Can be activated anywhere in the world, unless stated otherwise.

EU: Can only be activated in Europe (including the UK).

UK: Can only be activated in the United Kingdom.

US: Can only be activated in the United States.

Other region restrictions will also be listed on the product page when relevant. Always make sure the region of the game matches both your location and the account you plan to use, or the key may not work.

THE PRICE CHANGED FROM A FEW DAYS AGO, CAN I GET A REFUND ON THE DIFFERENCE?
10 days ago Updated

At Loaded, we always aim to bring you the best possible prices on our products. Sometimes, costs from our suppliers can change, which may lead to occasional price adjustments on our site.

Because of this, we cannot guarantee that prices will always stay the same, and we are unable to provide refunds for any price differences. This applies to both in-stock products and pre-order keys.
